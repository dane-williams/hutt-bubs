            <p>Possibly the best park in the Hutt Valley. Upgraded recently. Has a very good play area for the slightly older kids. A water play area and a small play area for the younger ones. All this plus a flat bike track, skate park, duck pond, seasonal train rides and brand new toilet block make it a must for parents looking to keep children entertained. </p>

            <p>Has two main areas. An older area that has flying fox and obstacle style park. Much better for the older kids. Its biggest plus is the newly built play area for the smaller kids. Decent play area but fully fenced. The park has recently had a new toilet built and is only a few hundred meters from a brand new dog park.</p>

            <p>The newest of the Hutt Valley parks. Another excellent area filled with plenty to do. Castles, musical instruments, flying fox, skate park and brand new toilet area. Close to a local ice skating rink and Brewtown which has go-carts and paint ball.  </p>
